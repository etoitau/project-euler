# It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest length of wire that can be 
# bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one 
# way, but there are many more examples.
# 12 cm: (3,4,5)
# 24 cm: (6,8,10)
# 30 cm: (5,12,13)
# 36 cm: (9,12,15)
# 40 cm: (8,15,17)
# 48 cm: (12,16,20)
# In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to 
# form an integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow 
# more than one solution to be found; for example, using 120 cm it is 
# possible to form exactly three different integer sided right angle 
# triangles.
# 120 cm: (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)
# Given that L is the length of the wire, for how many values of 
# L â‰¤ 1,500,000 can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be 
# formed?
# Result: 161667
