# If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue 
# discs and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random, it can 
# be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs, 
# P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.
# The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of 
# taking two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue 
# discs and thirty-five red discs.
# By finding the first arrangement to contain over 
# 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000 discs in total, determine the number of 
# blue discs that the box would contain.
# Result: 756872327473
